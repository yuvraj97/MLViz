Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this interactive **ML** Web app project.

**See it in action here**: https://mlviz97.herokuapp.com/

Here we try to make Machine Learning Fun by making bare concepts interactive.  
Here we can Tweak Parameters and see there effect in real time.   
We can also see the source code below the visualization.

## Visualization

Here you can generate n-dimensional synthetic data and see the concept in action.
